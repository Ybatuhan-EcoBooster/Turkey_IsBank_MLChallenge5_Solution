# Türkiye İş Bankası ML Challenge - 5 - 2023 Solution

I am making finance analysis in Python to handle big data. In this project, I participated  ML Challenge 2023 on Kaggle. I came in [41'nd](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/turkiye-is-bankasi-ml-challenge-5/leaderboard) among 284 competitors on Kaggle. I used mainly pandas,numpy, Catboost, and Sklearn libraries. Enjoy learning 🧭.

## What I did do that ML Challenge? 🔎

I predicted the most prefer menus given from  data sets with external factors. With this prediction, I used CatBoostClassifier machine learning models to forecast. Before that, I cleaned a Datasets. After that, I chose the Catboost model to take perfect results scores inside. You can find my process model working codes in [IS_ML5_Solution.ipynb](https://github.com/Ybatuhan-EcoBooster/Turkey_IsBank_MLChallenge5_Solution/blob/main/IS_ML5_Solution.ipynb) file.

## Conclusion 👨🏻‍💻

When I started Financial analysis, I discovered Python and other tools. I developed myself with open sources without any course. In this journey, I decided to improve myself in data analysis and Machine Learning with Finance . Türkiye İş Bankası ML Challenge - 5 was one of them. I joined this competition to gain experience and I came in 41'nd among 284 competitors. It is very challenging for me. But, I am happy with this score. 

I struggled to improve which ML model will be perfect for my data set prediction. I try each way to succeed. I learned many things on this journey. I will be increasing my skill with these mistakes.
